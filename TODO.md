in test()

If there are still elements on the stack then pop or free them.

Loop over each element.
Pop and free each one.

visualize stack with drawing library?

Accepts one argument:

opcode_INCREMENT

opcode_DUPLICATE
opcode_SWAP

opcode_DECREMENT

Takes stack index

push_index 3

Takes element 3 on stack and pushes it on top
If -2, takes second item from top and pushes on top (more complicated version)

opcode_add
opcode_subtract
integer type
opcode_print

Write assembler (Allows for binary representation of floats in the bytecode)

{
  add branching instructions and more arithmetic operators
} || {
  add cons
  Experiment with cons.
  Implement simple garbage collection.
  Experiment with cycles.
  Fix cycle collection if needed.
} || {
  Add sound instructions (VM synthesizer?)
}
